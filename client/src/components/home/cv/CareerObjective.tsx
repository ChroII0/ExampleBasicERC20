My career goal is to work on innovative blockchain projects that solve real-world problems. Through an internship, I hope to gain practical experience in smart contract programming, dApp development, and other related technologies, developing a strong foundation in blockchain development. Ultimately, I'm committed to working hard and contributing to the success of the organization.</p>
